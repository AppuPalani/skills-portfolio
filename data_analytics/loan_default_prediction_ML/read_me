# Loan Default Risk Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates a supervised machine learning approach to predicting loan default risk using a logistic regression model. 
It uses borrower financial data such as retirement age, debt amount, and monthly savings to predict whether the individual is at risk of loan default.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:
- `Retirement_Age`: The age at which the individual is expected to retire.
- `Debt_Amount`: The current outstanding debt.
- `Monthly_Savings`: Average amount saved per month.
- `Loan_Default_Risk`: Target variable (0 = No Default, 1 = Will Default)

There are missing values in some columns which are handled through **mean imputation**.

## üîç Objective

To build a **logistic regression classifier** that predicts the probability of a loan default, while:
- Handling missing data
- Addressing class imbalance
- Evaluating the model's performance using classification metrics

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Missing values imputed using the column mean.
   - No categorical variables; hence no encoding required.

2. **Train-Test Split**
   - 80% training, 20% testing.

3. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression with `class_weight='balanced'` to handle class imbalance.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
   - Confusion matrix visualization

---

## üìä Results

The model achieved **98% accuracy** with high recall and precision on both classes:

- Class 0 (No Default): 97% precision, 100% recall
- Class 1 (Will Default): 100% precision, 97% recall

Only **1 sample** was misclassified out of 60 test cases.

## üß† Key Takeaways

- **Imbalanced data** can be misleading if you only look at accuracy.
- Logistic regression performs well when combined with **class weighting**.
- Even small datasets can give strong insights with proper preprocessing.
