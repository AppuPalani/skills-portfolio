# 🤖 Loan Default Prediction – Logistic Regression

This project uses logistic regression to predict whether a loan application will be approved or defaulted based on applicant attributes.

## 📁 Dataset
- `Loan_default_Dataset.csv`  
  Contains demographic and financial features related to loan applications.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Jupyter / VSCode / CLI

## 📊 Workflow
1. Load and clean data
2. Encode categorical variables
3. Train/Test split
4. Train logistic regression model
5. Evaluate model accuracy and metrics

## 📌 Output Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)

## 📎 Next Steps
- Try alternate classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Create a dashboard in Power BI with feature insights
